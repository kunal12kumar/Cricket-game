# Cricket Game

This repository contains a simple cricket game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In this game, you play against the computer with simple rules that simulate a game of cricket. The game involves two players: you and the computer. The objective of the game is based on the choices of "Bat" and "Ball" made by the players, and the outcome depends on the selections.

## Rules of the Game

The game works based on the following logic:

1. **If you choose 'Bat' and the computer chooses 'Ball'**: You win.
2. **If you choose 'Ball' and the computer chooses 'Bat'**: The computer wins.
3. **If the computer chooses 'Stamp'**: The computer wins, regardless of what you choose.
4. **If you choose 'Bat' and the computer chooses 'Stamp'**: The computer wins.

The aim is to outsmart the computer by making the right choice, based on the random choice it makes. The game is simple and fun to play.

## Features

- **User Interaction**: Choose between 'Bat' or 'Ball' to play against the computer.
- **Computer Randomness**: The computer randomly selects its option (Bat, Ball, or Stamp).
- **Win/Loss Outcome**: Displays the result based on your choice and the computerâ€™s choice.
- **Responsive Design**: The game is designed to work on desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used
